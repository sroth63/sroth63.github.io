    <p>Notes on <em>The Scout Mindset</em> by Julia Galef</p>
    <h2>I The case for scout mindset</h2>
    <h3>I.1 Two types of thinking</h3>
    <p>Scout / soldier metaphor, Dreyfus affair</p>
    <h3>I.2 What the soldier is protecting</h3>
    <p>"I try to abide by the rule that when you advocate changing something, you should make sure you understand why it is the way it is in the first place. This rule is known as Chesterton’s fence, after G. K. Chesterton, the British writer who proposed it in an essay in 1929.1 Imagine you discover a road that has a fence built across it for no particular reason you can see. You say to yourself, “Why would someone build a fence here? This seems unnecessary and stupid, let’s tear it down.” But if you don’t understand why the fence is there, Chesterton argued, you can’t be confident that it’s okay to tear it down." -> we must understand the reasons of the solider mindset :</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Comfort</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sour grape: when we don't get something we want, we decide we shouldn't want it anyway</li>
          <li>Sweet lemon: convice ourselves that a problem that can't be fixed is a blessing "Until very recently in human history, excruciating pain was an unavoidable part of childbirth. Since there was nothing we could do about that, many doctors and clergy argued that pain was a good thing, because it promoted spiritual growth and strength of character. Labor pains were allotted by God, “and most wisely we cannot doubt,” one obstetrician assured people in 1856. Now that we have access to epidural anesthesia, we no longer insist on the sweetness of that particular lemon. But we still say similar things about aging and death—that they’re beautiful, and they give meaning to life."</li>
        </ul>
        <p>No point in preparing in a future disaster</p>
      </li>
      <li>Self-esteem: "we often use soldier mindset to protect our egos by finding flattering narratives for unflattering facts" "Poorer people are more likely to believe that luck plays a big role in life, while wealthier people tend to credit hard work and talent alone."</li>
      <li>Morale: irrational optimism motivates ourselves to do hard things</li>
      <li>Persuasion: convincing ourselves so that we can convince others</li>
      <li>Image: choosing beliefs that make us look good</li>
      <li>Belonging</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>I.3 Why truth is more valuable than we realize</h3>
    <p>"In this case, soldier mindset made the president better at persuading people to give him money, but worse at deciding how to use that money."</p>
    <p>"The hypothesis that the human mind evolved the ability to make these trade-offs well is called the rational irrationality hypothesis, coined by economist Bryan Caplan. If the name sounds like a paradox, that’s because it’s using two different senses of the word rational: epistemic rationality means holding beliefs that are well justified, while instrumental rationality means acting effectively to achieve your goals."</p>
    <p>"So, are we rationally irrational? If we were, there wouldn’t be much left for me to say in this book. I could appeal to your sense of altruism and encourage you to choose scout mindset more for the sake of being a good citizen. Or I could appeal to your innate love of truth for its own sake. But I couldn’t claim that additional scout mindset would make you personally better off if you were already striking an optimal balance between scout and soldier. The fact that this book is in your hands is a bit of a spoiler for my answer: No, we’re far from rationally irrational. There are several major biases in our decision-making, several ways in which we systematically misjudge the costs and benefits of truth. In the rest of this chapter, we’ll explore how those biases cause us to overvalue soldier mindset, choosing it more often than we should, and undervalue scout mindset, choosing it less often than we should."</p>
    <p>"So if our instincts undervalue truth, that’s not surprising—our instincts evolved in a different world, one better suited to the soldier. Increasingly, our world is becoming one that rewards the ability to see clearly, especially in the long run; a world in which your happiness isn’t nearly as dependent on your ability to accommodate yourself to whatever life, skills, and social groups you happened to be born into. More and more, it’s a scout’s world now."</p>
    <h2>II Developing self-awareness</h2>
    <h3>II.1 Signs of a scout</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Feeling objective doesn't make you a scout: "In fact, viewing yourself as rational can backfire. The more objective you think you are, the more you trust your own intuitions and opinions as accurate representations of reality, and the less inclined you are to question them."</li>
      <li>Being smart and knowledgeable doesn't make you a scout: "At the lowest levels of scientific intelligence, there’s no polarization at all—roughly 33 percent of both liberals and conservatives believe in human-caused global warming. But as scientific intelligence increases, liberal and conservative opinions diverge. By the time you get to the highest percentile of scientific intelligence, liberal belief in human-caused global warming has risen to nearly 100 percent, while conservative belief in it has fallen to 20 percent."</li>
      <li>Actually practicing scout mindset makes you a scout:</li>
      <li>Telling other people when you realize they were right: "Technically, scout mindset only requires you to be able to acknowledge to yourself that you were wrong, not to other people. Still, a willingness to say “I was wrong” to someone else is a strong sign of a person who prizes the truth over their own ego. Can you think of cases in which you’ve done the same?"</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>II.2 Noticing bias</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Double standard test: Are you judging one person (or group) by a different standard than you would use for another person (or group)?</li>
      <li>Outsider test: How would you evaluate this situation if it wasn’t your situation?</li>
      <li>Conformity test: If other people no longer held this view, would you still hold it?</li>
      <li>Selective skeptic test: If this evidence supported the other side, how credible would you judge it to be?</li>
      <li>Status quo bias test: If your current situation was not the status quo, would you actively choose it?</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>II.3 How sure are you?</h3>
    <p>"For example, many studies have found that doctors routinely overestimate their ability to diagnose patients. One study examined the autopsy results for patients who had been given diagnoses with “complete certainty,” and found that in 40 percent of those cases, the diagnosis was incorrect."</p>
    <p>A bet can reveal how sure you really are. Equivalent bet test: pin down how sure you are quantitatively. Ex: choose between</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>ball bet: draw from a bow with 4 balls, 1 of which is gray. If I draw the gray ball I get $10,000</p>
        <ul>
          <li>self-driving cars bet: if fully self-driving cars are available for purchase in a year, I get $10,000</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>III Thriving without illusions</h2>
    <h3>III.1 Coping with reality</h3>
    <p>"I like to imagine all of the possible coping strategies—all of the ways we could stave off negative emotions—piled up in a giant figurative bucket. Some involve self-deception, such as denying a problem or blaming it on a scapegoat. Others involve reminding yourself of a true fact, such as “I’ve handled problems like this successfully in the past.” Some coping strategies in the bucket don’t involve making a claim at all (and are therefore not self-deceptive), such as taking a deep breath and counting to ten."</p>
    <p>Coping strategies that don't require self-deception: count your blessings, notice how far you've come, remember you can't do more than your best</p>
    <p>"Of course, the fact that the “self-deception causes happiness” research is fatally flawed doesn’t prove that self-deception can’t cause happiness. It clearly can, in many cases. It just comes with the downside of eroding your judgment. And given that there are so many ways to cope that don’t involve self-deception, why settle?"</p>
    <h3>III.2 Motivation without self-deception</h3>
    <p>Motivation by self-belief: "Everything in life is a risk, but if you want it, you should go for it. If you worry about failing, that’s just going to be a self-fulfilling prophecy.". Might be true if there is no decision making involved, BUT an accurate picture of the odds helps you :</p>
    <ul>
      <li>choose between goals</li>
      <li>adapt your plans over time</li>
      <li>decide how much to stake on success</li>
    </ul>
    <p>"It might be motivating to believe with absolute certainty that you’re going to win, but it’s not realistic—there’s always some element of chance involved, in any endeavor. Over time, your outcomes will fluctuate; some of your bets will turn out well, and many will turn out poorly. But as long as you continue making positive expected value bets, that variance will mostly wash out in the long run. Building that variance into your expectations has the nice side effect of giving you equanimity. Instead of being elated when your bets pay off, and crushed when they don’t, your emotions will be tied to the trend line underneath the variance. The goal isn’t to attribute everything to luck. It’s to do your best to mentally separate out the role that luck plays in your results from the role that your decision-making plays, and to judge yourself based on the latter."</p>
    <p><strong>"Soldier morale can be effective, at least in the short term. But it’s a brittle kind of morale, one that requires you to avoid or rationalize away new information that could threaten your ability to keep believing in success. Scouts rely on a different kind of morale. Instead of being motivated by the promise of guaranteed success, a scout is motivated by the knowledge that they’re making a smart bet, which they can feel good about having made whether or not it succeeds."</strong></p>
    <h3>III.3 Influence without overconfidence</h3>
    <p>2 uncorrelated types of confidence:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Epistemic: being sure about what's true</li>
      <li>Social: being at ease in social situations</li>
    </ul>
    <p>People judge you on social confidence</p>
    <p>2 types of uncertainty:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Due to your ignorance or inexperience</li>
      <li>
        <p>Due to reality being messy and unpredictable -> usually appreciated, especially if:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>you show that uncertainty is justified</li>
          <li>give informed estimates</li>
          <li>have a plan</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>IV Changing your mind</h2>
    <h3>IV.1 How to be wrong</h3>
    <p>Revise your opinions incrementally over time</p>
    <p>View errors as opportunities to hone your skill at getting things right</p>
    <p>Admitting a mistake (you screwed up) ≠ updating (you weren't necessarily wrong to believe something that turned up to be wrong)</p>
    <h3>IV.2 Lean in to confusion</h3>
    <p>"The instinct to judge other people’s behavior as stupid, irrational, or crazy is very common, and it’s also a sign that there’s something you’re missing. This is a point that top negotiators all emphasize: don’t write off the other side as crazy. When their behavior confuses you, lean in to that confusion"</p>
    <p>"Leaning in to confusion is about inverting the way you’re used to seeing the world. Instead of dismissing observations that contradict your theories, get curious about them. Instead of writing people off as irrational when they don’t behave the way you think they should, ask yourself why their behavior might be rational. Instead of trying to fit confusing observations into your preexisting theories, treat them as clues to a new theory. Scouts view anomalies as puzzle pieces to collect as you go through the world. You probably won’t know what to do with them at first. But if you hang on to them, you may find that they add up to a richer picture of the world than you had before. As Isaac Asimov reportedly said: “The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new discoveries, is not ‘Eureka’ but ‘That’s funny . . .’”"</p>
    <h3>IV.3 Escape your echo chamber</h3>
    <p>Simply listening to the other side doesn't work in general</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Listen to people you find reasonable (by default, you will see mostly virulent people)</li>
      <li>Listen to people you share intellectual common ground with : "Litterman’s case for climate action relied on economics and uncertainty, a language Taylor already found compelling. To someone like Taylor, one conversation with a climate activist who can make their case in those terms is going to be far more valuable than one hundred conversations with activists who talk about humanity’s moral responsibility to Mother Earth."</li>
      <li>Listen to people who share your goals</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>V Rethinking identity</h2>
    <h3>V.1 How beliefs become identities</h3>
    <p>2 things that turn a belief into an identity:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Feeling embattled / mocked / persecuted / stigmatized</li>
      <li>Feeling proud / rebel</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Signs a belief might become an identity:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Using the phrase "I believe"</li>
      <li>Getting annoyed when an ideology is criticized</li>
      <li>Defiant language</li>
      <li>A righteous tone ("Period. Full Stop. End of Story. It's that simple")</li>
      <li>Gatekeeping ("You can't call yourself a feminist if you don' believe in the right to abortion")</li>
      <li>Schadenfreude (deriving pleasure from news that humiliates some ideological group you disagree with)</li>
      <li>Epithets (social justice warriors, feminazis, neckbeards, snowflakes, Woke Brigade, libtards)</li>
      <li>Having to defend your view</li>
    </ul>
    <p>"The problem with identity is that it wrecks your ability to think clearly." Ex: HIV can be transmitted by breastfeeding, some breastfeeders didn't want to believe that in the beginning</p>
    <h3>V.2 Hold your identity lightly</h3>
    <p>You can't just avoid identifying with any ideology, movement or group. Solution: hold your identity lightly. "Holding an identity lightly means thinking of it in a matter-of-fact way, rather than as a central source of pride and meaning in your life. It’s a description, not a flag to be waved proudly."</p>
    <p>"The ideological Turing test, suggested by economist Bryan Caplan, is based on similar logic. It’s a way to determine if you really understand an ideology: Can you explain it as a believer would, convincingly enough that other people couldn’t tell the difference between you and a genuine believer?"</p>
    <p>A strongly held identity prevents you from persuading others</p>
    <p>Is holding your identity lightly compatible with activism? There are usually trade-offs between identity and impact, and the more lightly you hold your identity, the more you can focus exclusively on actions with the highest impact.</p>
    <h3>V.3 A scout identity</h3>
    <p>"Throughout the last two chapters, we’ve seen how your identity is a hindrance to scout mindset, how thinking of yourself as “a feminist” or “an optimist” can shape your thinking and behavior in invisible ways, creating pressure to believe certain things and defend certain positions regardless of whether they’re true. This chapter is about a way to make that phenomenon work for us instead of against us by flipping the script and making scout mindset part of our identity."</p>
    <p>"If you strive to be a scout, it’s true that you won’t please everyone. However—as your parents may have told you growing up—that’s impossible anyway. So you might as well aim to please the kind of people you’d most like to have around you, people who you respect and who motivate you to be a better version of yourself."</p>
