Notes on _Against Democracy_ by Jason Brennan

= Hobbits and Hooligans

[p7]
I argue:
- Political participation is not valuable for most people. On the contrary, it does most of us little good, and instead tends to stultifyand corrupt us. It turns us into civic enemies who have grounds to hate one another.
- Citizens don’t have any basic right to vote or run for office. Political power, even the small amount of power contained in the right to vote, has to be justified. The right to vote is not like other civil liberties, such as freedom of speech, religion, or association.
- While there might be some intrinsically unjust forms of govern ment, democracy is not a uniquely or intrinsically just form of
  government. Unrestricted, equal, universal suffrage—in which
  each citizen automatically is entitled to one vote—is in many ways
  on its face morally objectionable. The problem is (as I will argue
  at length) that universal suffrage incentivizes most voters to make
  political decisions in an ignorant and irrational way, and then im  poses these ignorant and irrational decisions on innocent people.
  The only thing that could justify unrestricted, universal suffrage
  would be that we cannot produce a better-performing system.

[p8] Overall, democratic governments tend to perform better than the alternatives *we have tried*. But perhaps some of the systems we haven’t
tried are even better.

[p9] Political decision making is not choosing for oneself; it is choosing for everyone.

Proceduralism: some political system are intrinsically just or unjust\
Instrumentalism: we should just use the system that works the best

[p18]
we should not exclude citizens from driving because
they are atheists, gay, or Dalits. Yet that does not mean that all restrictions on the legal right to drive are unjust. There might be just reasons
to forbid some people from driving, such as that they are incompetent
drivers who impose too much risk on others when they drive.

[p23]
An individual vote for the
worst-possible candidate produces the same results as a vote for the
best-possible candidate. Abstaining from voting produces the same
results as voting. A well-informed vote produces the same results as a
badly informed, misinformed, or irrational vote. An individual vote
after careful deliberation produces the same results as voting after
flipping a coin or dropping acid. [_But it also applies to epistocracy???_]

= Ignorant, irrational, misinformed nationalists

People are ignorant (because they have no incentive in really trying to understand politics) and irrational (because of the way our brains work). _What about irrationality in epistocracies?_

[p33]
Political knowledge
is [slightly] positively correlated with being or leaning Republican, but negatively correlated with being a Democrat or leaning independent.

[p34]
As people (regardless of their race, income, gender, or other demographic
factors) become more informed, they favor overall less government intervention and control of the economy. (That’s not to say they become
libertarians.) They are more in favor of free trade and less in favor
of protectionism.

[p43]
Confirmation bias explains how we consume news and information. Most people only read news that supports their preexisting
opinions. Left-liberals read the New York Times. Conservatives flock
to Fox News.

[p49]
Political scientists have conducted numerous empirical studies of
voter behavior, using a wide variety of methods. They overwhelmingly conclude that voters do not vote selfishly. Instead, voters
tend to be nationalist and sociotropic. That is, they tend to vote for
what they perceive to be in the national interest rather than in their
self-interest.

[p50]
Rational,
selfish people would not vote selfishly. They wouldn’t vote at all, because the costs of casting a selfish vote exceed the expected benefits of
voting. [_Good argument against mandatory vote_]

= Political participation corrupts

[p58]
Some governments force citizens to vote, and this allows us to test
whether getting citizens to vote causes them to acquire greater levels
of knowledge.
The test results are negative. [_Seems really questionable_]

[p61]
When hooligans deliberate, the “force of the
better argument” is impotent. What matters are rhetoric, sex appeal,
and promoting the team. When hooligans deliberate, they get worse.

[p66]
Yet if we try to export these experiments to real-world decision
making, deliberative polls [_convention citoyenne_] are ripe for abuse. It’s one thing to have
moderated, controlled deliberate polls when nothing is at stake. It’s
another when such polls might actually choose policy. In the real
world, politicians and others will seek to control the agenda, frame
the debate in a way that is favorable to their position, distribute informational materials that favor their side and make the other side look
dumb, and so on. As I explored in chapter 2, how a question or debate
is phrased can easily lead people to switch their positions.
[...]
That said, the research on deliberative polling shows promise. It
may be able to overcome many of the problems of mass participation
and mass democracy. But advocates of deliberative polling don’t yet
have sufficient evidence to proclaim it a solution to our troubles or
counterexample to my general thesis that political participation tends
to corrupt.

[p68]
Citizens should weigh other citizens’ tes-
timony on the basis of how expert, reasonable, and reliable those citizens are likely to be, and revise their own beliefs accordingly. If the
citizens do not revise their beliefs accordingly, then their epistemic
situation has worsened. Deliberation made them more delinquent. [_But this is a moral argument, and the author claims he's an instrumentalist???_]

= Politics doesn't empower you or me

Debunking of 5 reasons for which politics is supposed to empower citizens  : consent, interests, autonomy, nondomination, moral development

[p88]
Democracy
isn’t meant to empower individuals; it’s intended to disempower all
the individuals in favor of large groups or collections of individuals.
Democracy empowers us, but not you or me.

[p97]
If we deprive all black people of the right to vote and run for
office, then this will help facilitate people of other races in exploiting,
dominating, and oppressing blacks. Yet this doesn’t show that it’s
valuable for any individual black person to possess the political liberties or participate in politics. Instead, at most it demonstrates that it’s
valuable to each black person that a sufficient number of black people
possess the political liberties.

[p110]
One of the complaints about epistocracy, compared to democracy,
is that it deprives some citizens of their share of power. But we’re
not denying citizens a slice of the pie of power. We’re denying them
crumbs.

= Politics is not a Poem

Criticism of the argument according to which voting right has a symbolic value / symbolizes dignity, respect or equality

[p117]
It could turn out that epistocracy ends up being smarter
than democracy, and for that reason does a better job of promoting
equal outcomes.

[p122]
If someone, for instance, starts choking in front of David[, a surgeon,] during
his Target shopping trip, he should not be modest. Someone’s life is
at stake. He should declare that he is a doctor—thus expressing that
he has superior medical judgment to others—and should be charged
with helping the choking customer. Suppose bystander Bob, who
has no medical training, says, “Hey, Doctor David, I want to help the
choking person too! It’s disrespectful of you to insist you help him.
You and I are equals. We should flip a coin to determine who will
help. Otherwise you’re hurting my feelings.” In this scenario, Bob
acts badly. David should take charge, and Bob should get over himself. Even if Bob sincerely believed he and David are equals, Bob is
negligent in holding this belief, and shouldn’t act on it.

_Maybe the problem is to decide which decisions should be taken democratically, instead of completely abandonning democracy?_

[p128]
This is not to deny that there is a fact about what we communicate
but rather to affirm that in the absence of nonsemiotic concerns, these
facts appear to be contingent and in principle open to revision. Societies construct codes that imbue certain behaviors with meaning. In
light of those codes, some behaviors will signify morally bad meanings.

[p129]
This association is only contingent; there is, as far as I can see, no
intrinsic or essential connection between status and political power.
It is a contingent, psychological or cultural fact that people tend to
associate human dignity with political power, or more specifically
with the right to vote.

[Trucs plutôt consensuels pour un meilleur système politique : meilleur système de vote, meilleure éducation (notamment à l'esprit critique), s'appuyer plus sur la science, meilleurs media, ne pas inciter à voter, moins d'importance aux personnalités politiques et plus à leurs idées, arrêter complètement le cumul des mandats, polis.]

[p129]
A world in which political power conferred no status might be a
better one than ours. We tie esteem to political power. But doing so
has a terrible track record. Just think of the abuses and injustices en-
tire nations, kings, emperors, presidents, senators, district attorneys,
police officers, and average voters have gotten away with through-
out history, all because we attach standing, reverence, and status to
political power, and defer before such majestic standing.

[p130]
Suppose a culture developed
the idea that the best way to respect the dead was by eating their raw,
putrefied corpses. In that culture, it really would be a (socially con-
structed) fact that failing to eat the dead expressed disrespect, while
eating rotting raw flesh would express respect. But suppose that eat-
ing raw, putrefied corpses tends to make people sick. [...] In that
case, the culture would have excellent reasons to eliminate its practice
and modify its semiotics.

[p133]
Now one worry about this is that it will cause epistocracy to advance disproportionately the interests of the already advantaged. I am
less worried about this than many democrats, because such concerns
seem to assume that people vote in their self-interest, the disadvan-
taged know enough about politics to choose policies that promote
their interests, and if the disadvantaged vote, politicians will respond
to them as much as they respond to the advantaged. I think these
assumptions are mistaken.

[p136] au sujet de l'argument selon lequel le vote permet la liberté d'expression
Just by
knowing whom someone voted for, you cannot infer what someone
meant to express.

[p139] Conclusion
When we ask what makes a hammer good, we judge it by how
well it functions. When we ask what makes a poem good, we often
judge it by what it symbolizes and expresses. When we judge what
makes a person good, we frequently say that people are valuable as
ends in themselves. As I see it, political institutions are more like
hammers than persons or poems.

= The right to competent government

[p143] pas trop d'accord, à garder en tête qu'il pense ça
The problem is that as individuals, we have little reason to change
our behavior. Consider some of my behaviors. I fly over twenty times
per year. I drive a twin-turbo sports sedan, which I generally leave in
Sport or Sport+ mode for maximal acceleration. I play electric guitar
through a high-wattage tube amp rather than acoustic guitar. I leave
the air conditioner on in my house all summer. I almost never shut
off any of my three computers. Out of the goodness of my heart, I
might reduce my energy usage, but what good would it do? My individual impact is so small that such sacrifices would make no difference. I would suffer, but it wouldn’t help.

[p147]
We might worry that most sixteen-year-olds lack the wisdom or knowledge to cast smart votes. Since politicians tend to give
voters what they want, lowering the voting age would produce lower-
quality government. We forbid them from voting because we want to
protect ourselves from them.
While many people accept this argument, it has implications they
aren’t inclined to accept. If ignorance is a sufficient reason to exclude
youths from voting, it should be sufficient reason to exclude large
swaths of the voting public.

[p149]
So instead of engaging in age discrimination, as modern democracies all do, why not subject everyone to a voter competence exam?
Why not say that by default, regardless of age, everyone starts off with
zero votes, but a person can acquire a right to vote provided they can
demonstrate competence? Interestingly, none of the deontological
arguments in chapters 4 or 5 addressed these questions at all. Most
democrats just assume that only adults should have the right to vote,
and they don’t reflect on why they think it permissible to exclude
children from voting.

=  Is Democracy Competent ?

[p172]
It’s
at least theoretically possible that the democratic electorate is competent as a collective whole even if the overwhelming majority of the
individuals within that body are incompetent at politics.

Debunking of 3 mathematicals theorems in favor of democracy (they're true but their hypothesis or conclusions aren't realistic)

[p174]
Many of the leading epistemic defenses of democracy are a priori and
theoretical, while epistemic critiques of democracy tend to be a posteriori or empirical.

[EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE INSTEAD OF A PRIORI PROOFS]

[p194]
The
empirical evidence not only gives us presumptive reasons to doubt
democracy but also tells us at the same time that the three theorems
don’t apply to real-life democracies.

[p194]
A much more promising route for epistemic democrats is to defend democracy on empirical grounds. Right now, for the most part,
democracies are better places to live than the nondemocracies. Democracies do not allow mass famine. Many scholars believe that democracies tend not to make war against one another, although some
dispute this theory. Democracies are systematically more likely than
existing monarchies, oligarchies, and one-party governments to recognize as well as protect civil and economic liberties. While I think
democracies systematically underperform, they perform wonder-
fully when compared to most historical alternatives.

[p196]
it’s true that the party system makes it easier for low-information voters to choose among the candidates presented to them, but at the
same time, because voters are badly informed, the quality of the candidates is much lower than it otherwise would be.

[p196]
DOES DEMOCRACY WORK WELL BECAUSE IT DOESN’T WORK?
Given how little voters know and how badly they process information, it’s not surprising that democracies frequently choose bad policies. But given how little voters know and how badly they process
information, it’s surprising democracies don’t perform even worse
than they do.

[p198]
It means that democracy works better than it otherwise would,
because it doesn’t exactly work. Democracy is supposed to give every
individual citizen equal voice, but it doesn’t. For whatever reason,
smarter and better-informed voters, with more enlightened policy
preferences, are better represented, with their preferences better realized, than less informed voters with less enlightened preferences.
Smarter and better-informed voters are more likely to get their way.

[p200]
In that sense, there are
epistocratic checks within a democratic system.
There is an impressive body of empirical literature in political sci-
ence showing how such factors mediate between what voters seem to
want during an election and what actually gets done. What democra-
cies do is not simply a function of voter preferences.

[p202]
Do elections matter
or not? This is a big question. In a sense, thousands of political scientists have devoted their careers to trying to answer this question. I
don’t want to do a hundred-page review of the empirical literature on
all the various mediating factors here. I read this literature as showing
that most major elections remain high stakes, if not as high stakes
as a naive fifth grader might think. Elections of officeholders do not
directly decide policy, but they significantly change the probability
that different policies will be implemented.

[Soit les élections importent, dans ce cas épisto > démo ; soit les élections n'importe pas / n'influencent rien, dans ce cas osef. Donc autant choisir l'épistocratie. Très critiquable car la transition démo -> épisto a un coût, et on a pas de preuves empiriques que l'épisto marche]

Either elections matter, in which case epistocracy > democracy; or elections don't matter, in which case we don't care. So we should chose epistocracy. [_But the transition democracy -> epistocracy costs time and money, and we don't have empirical evidence for epistocracy???_]

= The rule of the knowers

[p207]
Realistically, epistocracies will still feature the
rule of hooligans rather than vulcans, although epistocratic hooligans may be more vulcan-like than in democracy.

[p209] [Comprise between demo and episto : value-only voting]
Christiano believes the typical citizen is competent to deliberate
about and choose the appropriate aims of government. For citizens to
know the best means for achieving those aims, however, they would
have to become experts in sociology, economics, and political science.
[...]
Yet as Christiano recognizes, if they lack the social scientific
knowledge needed to choose among different candidates’ policy platforms, they will presumably also lack the social scientific knowledge
needed to determine whether the legislators have competently and
faithfully chosen policies that will realize citizens’ aims. [_But it remains better than democracy? How do you define values and means?_]

[p211]
A restricted suffrage epistocracy— or what I’ve previously called an elite electoral system—responds to this problem
by restricting political power to citizens who demonstrate a basic
level of knowledge.7 Everyone begins as an equal in this system. By
default, no one is entitled or permitted to exercise any degree of political power. They have extensive civil liberties to exercise political
speech, publish political ideas, protest, and so on, but not to vote.
Nonetheless, just as in most parts of the United States one cannot
become a judge without having demonstrated some basic level of
legal knowledge (for instance, by getting a law degree), an elite electoral system requires citizens to earn a license to vote (and perhaps
also to run for office).

[p212]
To keep the test objective and nonideological, we might limit it
to basic facts and fundamental, largely uncontested social scientific
claims. Much of this knowledge is strictly speaking irrelevant to any
given election. For instance, almost nothing in the US citizenship
exam is needed to be a good voter. Still, at least right now, a person
who possesses this knowledge is much more likely to have the kind
of knowledge that is relevant.
[...]
people might “cram for the
exam,” learning just the basic facts on the test and nothing else, and
so the exam would stop being a proxy for background social scientific
knowledge. It might be that effective voter qualification exams needrule of the knowers
to test basic social scientific knowledge, such as introductory micro-
economics and introductory political science.
To encourage the poor and disadvantaged to become good voters,
governments could offer incentives to citizens who can pass the exam
and acquire the right to vote. For instance, the government might
offer a prize: anyone who qualifies to vote gets a thousand-dollar tax
credit.

[p214] The enfranchisement lottery
Under López- Guerra’s scheme, by default, no one has the right to
vote. Everyone starts on an equal footing in that way. A lottery selects
a random but representative subset of citizens. Only these citizens
may earn the right to vote in the coming election (which will take
place shortly). The purpose of the lottery is to ensure that the voting
populace is likely to be identical in demographics to the populace
at large. Finally, these citizens engage in various deliberative forums
with one another, and are asked to study party platforms and the like.
[...]
That said, I worry, in light
of the facts about voter psychology and deliberation that I discussed
in chapters 2 and 3, that breeding competent voters is significantly
harder and more likely to fail than selecting for them. López- Guerra
is much more sanguine about deliberative democracy’s ability to
produce good voters than I am. Furthermore, he seems to have
lower standards for competence than I do. I think good voting requires knowledge not just about what candidates want to do and are
likely to be able to do but also social scientific knowledge about how
their preferred policies are likely to work. I doubt a couple days of
deliberation can impart that knowledge—after a semester’s worth
of study, most undergraduates still don’t understand, say, basic
microeconomics.

[p215] [Universal suffrage with epistocratic veto]
It has unrestricted,
equal universal suffrage. All citizens have equal rights to run for office and vote. The fair value of these political liberties is guaranteed.
Yet the system also has an epistocratic council, a formally episto-
cratic deliberative body. Membership in the epistocratic council is
potentially open to all members of society. Citizens may join the
epistocratic council only by passing rigorous competency exams, in
which they demonstrate strong background knowledge in the social
sciences and political philosophy.
[...]
This epistocratic council has no power to make law. It cannot appoint anyone to any office, nor can it issue any decrees or regulations.
It cannot instantiate any coercive regulations or rules on citizens.
But it has power to unmake law. The epistocratic council can thwart
others’ political decisions, but cannot make new decisions itself. It
can stop political action, but cannot initiate it. It can veto any (or almost any) political decisions made by the general electorate or its
representatives, on the grounds that the decisions were malicious,
incompetent, or unreasonable.

[p220] [Government by simulated oracle: _very interesting_]
We can administer surveys that track
citizens’ political preferences and demographic characteristics, while
testing their basic objective political knowledge. Once we have this
information, we can simulate what would happen if the electorate’s
demographics remained unchanged, but all citizens were able to get
perfect scores on tests of objective political knowledge. We can determine, with a strong degree of confidence, what “We the People” would
want if only “We the People” understood what we are talking about.

[p223]
The problem is that in the real world, we’re going to have to put
the task of deciding who counts as competent in someone’s hands.
That person might themselves be incompetent to decide who counts
as competent, or might use this power in bad faith.
In the real world, I’d expect there to be a political battle to control
what goes on any voter qualification exam. Just as congresspeople
now gerrymander districts to help ensure they’ll win, they might try
to control the exam for their own benefit. In the United States, the
Democratic Party has an incentive to make the exam easy, while the
Republicans have an incentive to make the exam moderately hard,
but not too hard. No doubt any such exam will be subject to abuse,
just as democratic procedures are abused in the real world. The question is just how badly abused the system would be.

[p225]
So
if we’re asking how to design a voter qualification test, why not let
democracy decide?
This might seem like a strange move to make. One might object
that if citizens are competent to decide what counts as competence,
why aren’t they thereby competent to choose good candidates for
office?
The answer is that it’s much easier for citizens to articulate a
concrete view of political competence than to identify and vote for
competent candidates.

[p226]
This leads to what we might call the demographic objection to
epistocracy:
Under any realistic epistocratic system, people who belong to certain already-advantaged groups are likely to acquire more power
than people who belong to certain disadvantaged groups. An epistocracy is thus likely to have unfair policies that serve the interests of the advantaged rather than those of the disadvantaged.
This sounds like a strong objection. I think there’s a grain of truth
in it, but it’s not as powerful as it appears at first glance. (Note also
that López- Guerra’s enfranchisement lottery avoids the objection
altogether.)

[p227] 
It seems, for starters, to presuppose that voters will each
vote for their self-interest or for those of whatever group they belong
to. But as already discussed in chapter 2, that’s false. [_But maybe conmpetent people just aren't aware of how incompetent people live???_]

[p228]
My view is that rather than insist everyone
vote, we should fix those underlying injustices. Let’s treat the disease,
not the symptoms.

[p228]
Consider, by analogy, how weak the case was for democracy as of
the mid-1790s. The French Revolution was supposed to replace what
was clearly an unjust regime with a better one. In the end, the result
was disaster. It led to war, mass tyranny, chaos, mass executions, and
ultimately the rise of Napoleon. Although Louis XVI’s reign was unjust and ineffective, the French might have done better putting up
with it than trying to replace it with something better.
[...]
That said, in the more than two hundred
years since, we’ve replaced most monarchies with democracies, and
overall it’s been for the better. A similar point might apply to epistocracy. Or it might not.

= Civic Enemies

[p233]
The results are depressing: 80.4 percent of Democratic subjects
picked the Democratic job candidate, while 69.2 percent of Republican subjects picked the Republican job candidate. Even when the
Republican job candidate was clearly stronger, Democrats still chose
the Democratic candidate 70 percent of the time. In contrast, they
found that “candidate qualification had no significant effect on winner section.” In other words, the evaluators didn’t care about how
qualified the candidates were; they only cared about what the job
candidates’ politics were.
