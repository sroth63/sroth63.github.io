Notes on _Atomic Habits_ by James Clear

= The fundamantals: why tiny changes make a big difference
== The surprising power of atomic habits

- Leverage exponential growth: 1\% better every day => 37 times better after a year. However, habits can work against you: if you repeat 1\% errors which seem insignificant => eventually a big problem. You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results.

- Valley of diappointment: you except linear progress but it doesn't work. Then you break through the Plateau of latent potential, and progress happens all at once.

- Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress. Problems when you focus too much on goals instead of systems:
  - winners and losers have the same goals
  - achieving a goal is only a momentary change, you treat a symptom without addressing the cause
  - goals restrict happiness, whereas if you focus on systems, you can be satisfied anytime your system is running
  - once you have achieved a goal, you will be tempted to revert to your old habits

- Atomic habits: tiny changes that are part of a larger system

== How your habbits shape your identity (and vice versa)

- We often try to change the wrong thing.

- 3 layers of behavior change:
  - changing what you get: outcomes / results / goals
  - changing what you do: process / habits / systems
  - changing what you believe: identity / worldview / judgments / self-image
  The 3 layers are important, but the problem is the direction of the change: you should start with identity-based habits

- True behavior change is identity change. You might start a habit because of motivation, but the only reason you'll stick with one is that it becomes part of your identity. The goal is not to read a book / run a marathon / learn an instrument, the goal is to _become_ a reader / runner / musician

- Once a person believes in a particular aspect of their identity, they are more likely to act in alignment with that belief

- 2-step process:
  - Decide who you want to be.
  - Prove it to yourself with small wins.

== How to build better habits in 4 simple steps

- As habits are created, the level of activity in the brain decreases and everything becomes automatic (ex: whenever you feel stressed, you get the itch to run). Incredibly useful because the conscious mind is the bottleneck of the brain.

- Habits don't restrict freedom, they create it: freedom requires health habits, learning habits,...

- 4 necessary stages to create a habit: cue, craving, response, reward. They form a feedback loop.

- Rewards are the end goal of every habit. They serve 2 puproses: they satisfy us and they teach us what actions are worth remembering

- How to create a good habit: make it obvious, attractive, easy, satisfying. How to break a bad habit: make it invisible, unattractive, difficult, unsatisfying.

= The 1st law: make it obvious
== The man who didn't look right

- The ﬁrst step to changing bad habits is to be on the lookout for them.

== The best way to start a new habit

- 2 most common cues: time and location. You should leverage these cues.

- Implementation intention: I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].

- Habit stacking: After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].

== Motivation is overrated, environment often matters more

- In one study, scientists instructed insomniacs to get into bed only when they were tired. If they couldn’t fall asleep, they were told to sit in a diﬀerent room until they became sleepy. Over time, subjects began to associate the context of their bed with the action of sleeping, and it became easier to quickly fall asleep when they climbed in bed.

- Habits can be easier to change in a new environment.

- Whenever possible, avoid mixing the context of one habit with another. I know a writer who uses his computer only for writing, his tablet only for reading, and his phone only for social media and texting.

== The secret to self-control

- Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one.
  You may be able to resist temptation once or twice, but it's
  unlikely you can muster the willpower to override your
  desires every time. Instead of summoning a new dose of  
  willpower whenever you want to do the right thing, your
  energy would be better spent optimizing your environment.

- Make bad cues invisible. Remove a single cue and the entire habit often fades away.

= The 2nd law: make it attractive
== How to make a habit irresistible

- It is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulﬁllment of it—that gets us to take action. The greater the anticipation, the greater the dopamine spike.

- Habit stacking + temptation bundling:
  + After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [HABIT I NEED].
  + After [HABIT I NEED], I will [HABIT I WANT].

== The role of family and friends in shaping your habits

- One of the most eﬀective things you can do to build
  better habits is to join a culture where (1) your desired
  behavior is the normal behavior and (2) you already
  have something in common with the group.

- If a behavior can get us approval, respect, and praise, we ﬁnd it attractive.

== How to find and fix the causes of your bad habits

- Highlight the beneﬁts of avoiding a bad habit to make
  it seem unattractive.

- Habits are attractive when we associate them with
  positive feelings and unattractive when we associate
  them with negative feelings.

- Find something that
  makes you truly happy—like petting your dog or taking a
  bubble bath—and then create a short routine that you
  perform every time before you do the thing you love.
  Maybe you take three deep breaths and smile.

= The 3rd law: make it easy
== Walk slowly, but never backward

- The most eﬀective form of learning is practice, not
  planning. Ex: an experiment found that students who took 100 photos did better than students who only took one, but tried to make it perfect.

- Habits form
  based on frequency, not time.

== The law of least effort

- Create an environment where doing the right thing is
  as easy as possible.

- Reduce the friction associated with good behaviors.
  When friction is low, habits are easy.

- Increase the friction associated with bad behaviors.
  When friction is high, habits are diﬀicult.

== How to stop procrastinating by using the two-minute rule

- Two-minute rule: when you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.

- The more you ritualize the beginning of a process, the
  more likely it becomes that you can slip into the state
  of deep focus that is required to do great things.

- Standardize before you optimize. You can't improve a
  habit that doesn't exist.

== How to make good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible

- Sometimes success is less about making good habits
  easy and more about making bad habits hard. This is an
  inversion of the 3rd Law of Behavior Change: _make it
  diﬀicult_.

- The ultimate way to lock in future behavior is to
  automate your habits.

- Using technology to automate your habits is the most
  reliable and eﬀective way to guarantee the right
  behavior.

= The 4th law: make it satisfying
== The cardinal rule of behavior change

- We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying. Ex: soap, chewing gum, toothpaste have more success when they smell/taste good.

- We are not looking for just any type of satisfaction. We are looking for immediate satisfaction. Our ancestors lived in immediate-return environments.

== How to stick with good habits every day

- Making progress is satisfying.

-  A habit tracker provides clear
  evidence of your progress. It's obvious, attractive, satisfying.

- If you fail, which is normal, recover as quickly as possible.

- Dark side of tracking a particular behavior: we
  become driven by the number rather than the purpose
  behind it (Goodhart's Law).

== How an accountability partner can change everything

- We repeat bad habits because they serve us in some way,
  and that makes them hard to abandon. The best way I know
  to overcome this predicament is to increase the speed of
  the punishment associated with the behavior.

- An accountability partner can create an immediate cost
  to inaction. We care deeply about what others think of
  us, and we do not want others to have a lesser opinion
  of us. Knowing that someone else is watching you can be a
  powerful motivator.

= Advanced tactics

== The truth about talent (when genes matter and when they don't)

- You should build habits that work
  for your personality. You don't have to build the habits everyone
  tells you to build. Choose the habit that best suits you, not
  the one that is most popular.

- Play a game that favors your strengths. If you can't ﬁnd
  a game that favors you, create one.


- Genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They
  clarify it. They tell us _what_ to work hard on.

== The Goldilocks rule: how to stay motivated in life and work

- Goldilocks rule:
  peak motivation occurs when working on tasks that are right
  on the edge of our current abilities.

- The greatest threat to success is not failure but
  boredom.

- The only way to become excellent is to be endlessly
  fascinated by doing the same thing over and over. You have
  to fall in love with boredom.

== The downside of creating good habits

- The upside of habits is that we can do things without
  thinking. The downside of habits is that you get used to
  doing things a certain way and stop paying attention to
  little errors.

- Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery

- Reﬂection and review is a process that allows you to
  remain conscious of your performance over time.

- The tighter we cling to an identity, the harder it
  becomes to grow beyond it.
