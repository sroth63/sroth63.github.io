- Read each chapter twice before going on to the next one.
- As you read, stop frequently to ask yourself how you can apply each suggestion.
- Review this book each month.
- Apply these principles at every opportunity.
- Check up each week on the progress you are making. Ask yourself what mistakes you have made, what improvement, what lessons you have learned for the future.

= Part 1: Fundamental techniques in handling people

== Principle 1: Don't criticize, condemn or complain.

John Wanamaker [...] once confessed, “I learned thirty years ago
that it is foolish to scold. I have enough trouble overcoming my own limitations without fretting over the fact
that God has not seen fit to distribute evenly the gift of intelligence.”

ninety-nine times out of a hundred, people don’t criticize
themselves for anything, no matter how wrong it may be.

Criticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes him strive to justify
himself. Criticism is dangerous, because it wounds a person’s precious pride, hurts his sense of importance, and
arouses resentment.

The resentment that criticism engenders can demoralize [...], and
still not correct the situation that has been condemned.

Let’s
realize that the person we are going to correct and condemn will probably justify himself or herself, and
condemn us in return

And when Mrs. Lincoln and others spoke harshly of the southern people, Lincoln replied, “Don’t
criticize them; they are just what we would be under similar circumstances.”

Do you know someone you would like to change and regulate and improve? Good! That is fine. I am
all in favor of it, but why not begin on yourself? From a purely selfish standpoint, that is a lot more profitable
than trying to improve others—yes, and a lot less dangerous. “Don’t complain about the snow on your
neighbor’s roof,” said Confucius, “when your own doorstep is unclean.”

When dealing with people, let us remember we are not dealing with creatures of logic. We are dealing
with creatures of emotion, creatures bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity.

“A great man shows his greatness,” said Carlyle, “by the way he treats little men.”

Instead of condemning people, let’s try to understand them. Let’s try to figure out why they do what
they do. That’s a lot more profitable and intriguing than criticism, and it breeds sympathy, tolerance and
kindness. “To know all is to forgive all.”

== Principle 2: Give honest and sincere appreciation.

The only way I can get you to do anything is by giving you what you want.

What do you _want_?

It is what Freud calls “the desire
to be great.” It is what Dewey calls the “desire to be important”.

If some people are so hungry for a feeling of importance that they actually go insane to get it, imagine
what miracle you and I can achieve by giving people honest appreciation this side of insanity.

“I consider my ability to arouse enthusiasm among my people,” said Schwab, “the greatest asset I
possess, and the way to develop the best that is in a person is by appreciation and encouragement.

Of course flattery seldom works with discerning people. It is shallow, selfish and insincere. It ought to
fail and it usually does. True, some people are so hungry, so thirsty, for appreciation that they will swallow
anything, just as a starving man will eat grass and fishworms.

The difference between appreciation and flattery? That is simple. One is sincere and the other
insincere. One comes from the heart out; the other from the teeth out. One is unselfish; the other selfish. One is
universally admired; the other universally condemned.

When we are not engaged in thinking about some definite problem, we usually spend about 95 percent
of our time thinking about ourselves. Now, if we stop thinking about ourselves for a while and begin to think of
the other person’s good points, we won’t have to resort to flattery so cheap and false that it can be spotted
almost before it is out of the mouth.

Emerson said: “Every man I meet is my superior in some way. In that, I learn of him.”

If that was true of Emerson, isn’t it likely to be a thousand times more true of you and me? Let’s cease
thinking of our accomplishments, our wants. Let’s try to figure out the other person’s good points. Then forget
flattery. Give honest, sincere appreciation. Be “hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise,” and
people will cherish your words and treasure them and repeat them over a lifetime—repeat them years after you
have forgotten them.

== Principle 3: Arouse in the other person an eager want.

Why talk about what we want? That is childish. Absurd. Of course, you are interested in what you
want. You are eternally interested in it. But no one else is. The rest of us are just like you: we are interested in
what we want.
